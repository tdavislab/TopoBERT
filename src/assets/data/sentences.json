  "316": "Bit sketchy , sporadic delivery times",
  "317": "I bought about half of the furniture I own from this place .",

  "334": "It has been 3 weeks and I STILL do n't have my table ( which was NOT cheap , I might add ) .",
  "335": "Point is : You might be able to get a good deal on some nice furniture -- which I did -- but they 're not very communicative and god forbid something goes wrong , you 'll have to fight to get it resolved .",

  "393": "B&B came out very quickly to give us our quote back in June .",
  "394": "They were very polite , eager to answer any questions and willing to wait for us to return from vacation to begin installing our fence .",
  "395": "Our fence was installed quickly in August and they had their money and left saying \" Workmanship is guaranteed for a year ! \" .",

  "398": "We heard nothing .",
  "399": "We then called the office and the man we spoke to said he 'd send someone out to look at it but could n't promise when - two weeks came and went and we heard nothing .",
  "400": "I just called again and was told that workmanship , not wood , is guaranteed for a year - well in my opinion - the wood split due to a nail which is part of workmanship !",
  "401": "She even went so far as to say \" You r calling about one board ? \"",
  "402": "Well - when you pay over $ 1000 for something you want it to hold up and look good !!!",
  "403": "YES !",
  "404": "I WAS calling about one board !!",
  "405": "I 'm very frustrated at this point - it would take all of 10 min for them to come by and replace the one board that is cracked ( the crack is deep enough to stick a penny in it and it goes clear through ) yet they do not want to take the time to bother with what once WAS a happy customer and has now become a dissatisfied customer .",
  "406": "So I figure if they do n't want to take the time to fix the fence that they installed then I 'll take the time to let everyone I can know about how they treat customers once they have your money !!!",
  "407": "STAY AWAY !!!",
  "408": "YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR !!!",
  "409": "They came in under a lot of other quotes and now I know why !!!",

  "434": "She highly recommended him and described him as the \" Saintly Instructor and Simply the Best Instructor there is .... very calm , pleasant and very detailed in giving instructions \" .",
  "435": "I called the school most probably 10 times before I finally enrolled in a 20 hour package .",
  "436": "I had to cancel my initial lesson 4 times and on the 5th attempt the management was quick enough to associate my cancellations with my fear and finally encouraged me into taking my initial lesson .",
  "437": "Five minutes before my initial lesson , I got a call from Gerry advising me of his arrival and to come down as soon as I was ready .",
  "438": "My heart pounded as I walked down and pounded even faster upon seeing Gerry in an SUV - Lexus !",

  "459": "The worst thing that can happen for any restaurant like Zahav is to have too many people write hyperbolic reviews making claims that \" everyone \" is going to \" love \" the food , decor and service .",
  "460": "The truth is , in my and my dining partners ' experience , this is a fine little restaurant with some unique food .",
  "461": "It 's an entirely up and down experience , however .",
  "462": "Now , the best of that unique food comes at the very beginning of the meal .",
  "463": "The salatim salads are the smallest plates I 've ever seen placed in front of me ( you would most likely think they were condiments if it were n't explained to you ) .",
  "464": "Though they are mostly excellent , you generally do n't get enough forkfuls to know if you really love them .",
  "465": "That being said , the laffa and hummus are out of this world .",
  "466": "Then again , for the three of us who dined together , two pieces of flatbread left us fighting for more , and licking the hummus from our fingers ( and yes , those two pieces of flatbread did represent a three - person order ) .",
  "467": "Dinner was also an up - and - down experience .",
  "468": "The vegetarian dishes and lighter fare were almost always spot - on , while the lamb was often dry and / or overcooked .",
  "469": "The duck was a 65 % glob of chewy fat with no resemblance to the juicy , crispy delicacy it usually represents at other establishments .",
  "470": "Dessert was ... hmmm , that 's interesting , I do n't even remember dessert .",
  "471": "I guess that tells you a lot .",
  "472": "Oh , yes , the chocolate semifreddo was quite good .",
  "473": "The warm chocolate cake was very tasty , but served at room temperature , not warm by any stretch of the imagination .",
  "474": "And my -- no , I still do n't remember what I had .",
  "475": "Service was average , but nothing special , and restaurants that are supposed to be excellent should do a better job of training their waitstaff to be communicative and friendly , not merely capable .",
  "476": "Perhaps had we not gone into this restaurant believing Zahav was going to be golden as its name suggests ( and as the many golden reviews seem to attest ) , we would have enjoyed a decent little expensive experience .",
  "477": "But one should not go here expecting something fantastic , unless perhaps you 've never had middle - eastern food before , or succulent duck , tasty lamb , decent portion sizes or actually warm chocolate desserts .",
  "478": "PS ) When we called for a reservation , we were told that 5:00 and 9:30 were their only openings .",
  "479": "When we arrived at 5 , and left circa 7 , there were the same 4 or 5 empty tables surrounding us .",
  "480": "Did they think we were going to feel lucky to get any reservation at all , and therefore be more pleased with our dining experience ?",
  "481": "I just like the fact that he was able to do the specific type of repair I wanted ( a reball ) and give me the longest warranty and even a lower price .",

  "490": "I have no doubt that the rescue is wonderful .",
  "491": "But I had my cat spayed through their reduced / free spay and neuter program and the vet they sent us to was first of all a hour and a half away , and 4 days later we had to bring them to our normal vet because the vets at the place in wisconsin did a crappy job and they got infections .",
  "492": "My vet even said it was not my fault it was the vet that did the surgery , So I would not recommend getting that program unless you have an extra hundred dollars or so for antibiotics and a vet visit .",
  "493": "You 'd think they would do a good job but they do n't care unless they are getting paid full price .",
  "494": "Which is so dumb .",
  "495": "Not to mention the fact that they gave us our cats back not even 30 minutes after they were out from surgery .",
  "496": "The staff leaves a lot to be desired .",
  "497": "The front staff has seen quite a bit of turnover and changed from professional to rude .",

  "504": "friendly , fine food",
  "505": "The one - star review from 2005 is out of date .",
  "506": "There was a change of ownership a couple of years ago and service is both quick and extremely friendly .",
  "507": "The food continues to be very good -- deli sandwiches , homemade soups , fresh salads .",
  "508": "The atmosphere may not be for everyone .",
  "509": "It is a bustling place where separate parties are seated at the same table ( as in many European cafes ) , but if you are OK with that , the food is very good .",

  "569": "We decided to try this place last night because we noticed that it had some interesting things on the menu aside from the usual rolls -- live scallop sashimi , duck breast nigiri with foie gras , panko mussels -- but none of these were particularly great or worth the sticker price .",
  "570": "Additionally we tried the Logan Circle roll , spicy crab and tuna roll , and sweet potato tempura roll ( $ 15 , $ 10 , and $ 3.75 respectively ) .",
  "571": "The sweet potato tempura roll was actually a great surprise : cheap and delicious , the only thing we tried that I would say was well worth it and a great value ( and I never get vegetarian rolls ) .",

  "765": "The second vendor charged $ 55 ( less than half of what A&E charges ) to come and applied that to the price of the repair service ( which A&E does not ) .",
  "766": "Their quote came in at half the price of A&E for the same work and same part .",
  "767": "Seems to me like A&E charges way more than necessary !",

  "801": "I could not understand any his reasons .",

  "2087": "I waited about 20 minutes in the store part before anyone was able to assist me and was then told to pull my car into the shop ( that is apparently what you are supposed to do , but the big signs pointing you that way are for some reason kept inside the garage , so you do n't see them drving up , and they purposely block the front pull - up that all other Sear's use ) .",
  "2088": "Once inside , I had to stand around for at least 10 more minutes before -- FINALLY -- a technician got to me .",
  "2089": "Once I returned to pick up my car , you can believe I spent quite a bit MORE time standing around waiting .",

  "2095": "Once again , I waited for quite a bit before being attended to .",
  "2096": "I got the order completed , and then questioned the technician since it came out about $ 40 less than I expected .",
  "2097": "He said it was the same tire , and verified this , after checking both the actual tire on my car and my service papers from earlier in the week .",
  "2098": "However , when he printed out the service quote , I could see that it was NOT the correct tire , and was not even an appropriate tire for my car model .",
  "2099": "So I pointed this out to him , at which point he said they only had one of the correct tires in stock .",
  "2100": "Ok -- fine .",
  "2101": "So I got just my other rear tire replaced .",

  "2107": "The next day , no one could find my wheel lock and that particular technician was not in .",
  "2108": "Of course , they could n't call him either to ask about it because apparently they do n't keep their employees ' phone numbers ( riiight ) , so I would have to return on Monday ( driving for 3 days now with no wheel lock should I get a flat ) .",
  "2109": "On Monday I called and again it was a big to - do to find anyone who knew anything about it .",
  "2110": "Supposedly they will be holding it for me this evening , but I 'm sure that will also be a huge ordeal .",

  "2123": "I was not impressed , and quite frustrated at their lack of rating for their courses .",
  "2124": "I understand not wanting to put labels like 5.10 on an indoor course , because yes , it is not the same , but some clear understanding of the difficulty of one course to another is nice when you are an intermediate climber looking to improve .",

  "2255": "Very affordable ( do n't call it cheap ) and their trimmers were quick and courteous when I got home from work .",
