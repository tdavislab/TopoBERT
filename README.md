# TopoBERT: A Visual Tool for Exploring Word Representations from Fine-Tuned Transformer Models

TopoBERT is a visual analytics tool for analyzing intermediate representations for transformer models such as BERT fine-tuned on specific tasks using tools from Topological Data Analysis.
The system allows users to interactively explore the fine-tuning process and change parameters of the visualization algorithm.
TopoBERT is aimed at NLP practitioners who want to explore the fine-tuning process of transformer models and for linguistic experts interested in understanding the lexical, synactic, and semantic concepts captured by the model.

## Requirements
TopoBERT requires following a working Docker installation
